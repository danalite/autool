Posts and pages are registered as default post types in the WordPress app. But sometimes, that is not enough. That\'s where custom post types (CPT) and custom taxonomies come in. This blog post will cover the basics of registering CPTs and taxonomies using Eightshift Dev Kit.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n## Why should you use CPTs?\\nThe great thing about WordPress is how extensible it is. With projects becoming more complex, the need for additional post types and taxonomies increases. Sure, you can cram everything into default posts or pages, but this can become very chaotic. Using custom post types allows you to manage your content much better. You can separate events and projects from news articles for instance.\\n\\nPost `category` and `tag` are taxonomies - a grouping you can further separate by terms belonging to that taxonomy. WordPress, since version 2.3.0 offers a way to register your own, custom taxonomies.\\n\\n## Registering Custom Post Types\\nFor this exercise, we\'ll create a new post type called `Projects`. To make the process of registering new CPTs as easy as possible, we\'ll use a WP-CLI command to create our CPT with the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\nwp boilerplate create post-type --label=\'Project\' --plural_label=\'Projects\' --slug=\'project\' --rewrite_url=\'project\' --rest_endpoint_slug=\'projects\'\\n```\\n\\n> If your new CPT is not working, try flushing rewrite rules by re-saving the settings in **Settings -> Permalinks** or by using `wp cache flush` CLI command\\n\\nYour new post type is registered and ready to use! Easy, right?\\n\\nSometimes all these parameters can be a bit confusing, so here\'s a quick reference of best practices when setting these parameters:\\n\\n| Parameter          | Singular/Plural | Writing style | Example  |\\n|--------------------|-----------------|---------------|----------|\\n| label              | Singular        | Regular       | Project  |\\n| plural_label       | Plural          | Regular       | Projects |\\n| slug               | Singular        | kebab-case    | project  |\\n| rewrite_url        | Singular        | kebab-case    | project  |\\n| rest_endpoint_slug | Plural          | kebab-case    | projects |\\n\\nThere is a reason for this naming convention. For example:\\n- `slug` is attached to a single custom post type in the database, which is why it is written in singular\\n- `rest_endpoint_slug` is used to fetch a collection of posts from that custom post type, which is why it should be written in plural\\n\\n## Registering Taxonomies\\nNow that we have the new custom post type, we need a way to group the projects. We\'ll create a custom taxonomy called `Project Technology`. As with the CPT registration, the easiest way to register taxonomies is by using the following WP-CLI command:\\n\\n```bash\\nwp boilerplate create taxonomy --label=\'Project Technology\' --plural_label=\'Project Technologies\' --slug=\'project-technology\' --rest_endpoint_slug=\'project-technologies\' --post_type_slug=\'project\'\\n```\\n\\nSimilar suggestions apply to the parameters when naming taxonomies as well. Be sure to write the correct post type slug for which you are registering this new taxonomy!\\n\\n## Structure\\nWhen checking your codebase after adding these new custom post types and taxonomies, you\'ll notice the post types are located inside the `src/CustomPostType` folder, and the taxonomies are located inside the `src/CustomTaxonomy` folder. Following the **Single Responsibility Principle**, each post type or taxonomy is in a separate class.\\n\\n## Modifying options\\nOur custom post type and taxonomy are ready to use, but we still want to make some changes. For starters, we want another icon and for the Projects to be located below the Posts in the WordPress admin menu. In `src/CustomPostType/ProjectPostType.php`, find the `MENU_POSITION` constant and change it to `5`. The lower the number, the higher it will be in the menu.\\n\\nNext, we want to update the icon representing the new post type in the menu. These icons are named dashicons. Change the `MENU_ICON` constant to `dashicons-clipboard`. If you want another icon for your CPT, here is the list of [available dashicons](https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/). Finally, we want to remove the author and comments. In `getPostTypeArguments()` method, find the key `supports` in the return value and remove `author` and `comments` from the array.\\n\\n## Clashing slugs\\nSomething that can happen when working on your project is that you have the same slugs for your custom post type and your page, for example. Let\'s say you have a page with a slug `project`, and a custom post type with a slug `project`. When trying to access the page, you\'ll keep getting the Project CPT archive. To fix it, you have to change one of the slugs or write a custom redirection rule (which we don\'t recommend, as the redirections are tricky to handle in WordPress).\\n\\n## Further reading\\nFor the best overview of all the options you have when registering your custom post type or taxonomy, we recommend checking the official WordPress docs for the [register_post_type()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_post_type/) and [register_taxonomy()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_taxonomy/) functions.\\n\\nIf you would like to know more about taxonomies and terms, along with how they are stored in the database, you can read more about it in the [Categories, Tags, & Custom Taxonomies](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/categories-tags-custom-taxonomies/) page of the WordPress docs."},{"id":"block-variations","metadata":{"permalink":"/autool/blog/block-variations","source":"@site/blog/2022-09-07-block-variations.md","title":"Block Variations","description":"Intro to block variations and examples of how to use them","date":"2022-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 7, 2022","tags":[{"label":"eightshift","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/eightshift"},{"label":"boilerplate","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/boilerplate"},{"label":"block","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/block"},{"label":"variations","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/variations"}],"readingTime":3.04,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Igor Obradovi\u0107","title":"WordPress Engineer","url":"https://github.com/iobrado","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23059501?v=4","key":"obradovic"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Block Variations","description":"Intro to block variations and examples of how to use them","slug":"block-variations","authors":"obradovic","date":"2022-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["eightshift","boilerplate","block","variations"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Using Custom Post Types and Taxonomies","permalink":"/autool/blog/using-cpts-and-taxonomies"},"nextItem":{"title":"How to use ACF in your project","permalink":"/autool/blog/acf-in-a-project"}},"content":"Let\'s picture the following scenario: You just created a block with many options and now you want multiple versions of that block available with pre-set options. That\'s where variations come in handy!\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## What are variations?\\n\\nBlock variations allow us to override default block attributes. We can select a variation from the block list with all preset options instead of manually setting them.\\n\\n> Please note that you cannot add new attributes in variations. Only attributes that exist in the parent block can be used.\\n\\nFor example, we have a `Card` block. If we want to use it for something like downloading PDF files, we may not need image or paragraph components. A simple text that describes type of the file, title of the file and a download button are all we need in this case.\\n\\nOur new card should consist of the following components:\\n- intro\\n- heading\\n- button\\n\\n## How to register a block variation?\\n\\nThe process of registering block variations is fairly simple. In order to register a block variation, go to **src/Blocks/variations**, add a new folder, and let\'s call it `card-resource`. Inside that folder, all you need to do is add a `manifest.json` file. It is also recommended to add a `docs` folder in which you can add a readme file and storybook file.\\n\\nInside your `manifest.json` file, add the attributes to define the new default attributes for this variation. Here is an example:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n\\t\\"$schema\\": \\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infinum/eightshift-frontend-libs/develop/schemas/variation.json\\",\\n\\t\\"parentName\\": \\"card\\",\\n\\t\\"name\\": \\"card-resource\\",\\n\\t\\"title\\": \\"Card Resource\\",\\n\\t\\"description\\" : \\"Card variation without image and paragraph\\",\\n\\t\\"icon\\": {\\n\\t\\t\\"src\\": \\"es-card\\"\\n\\t},\\n\\t\\"attributes\\": {\\n\\t\\t\\"cardCardImageUse\\": false,\\n\\t\\t\\"cardCardParagraphUse\\": false,\\n\\t\\t\\"cardCardHeadingSize\\": \\"regular\\",\\n\\t\\t\\"cardCardButtonColor\\": \\"blue\\"\\n\\t},\\n\\t\\"scope\\": [\\n\\t\\t\\"inserter\\"\\n\\t]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAfter adding this code, your new block variation should now be visible in the block list. It\'s that easy!\\n\\n![Variation of the Card block](/img/blog/card-resource.png)\\n\\n## Providing inner block data\\nOther than overriding default attributes with variations, you can do much more with Eightshift Development kit. If you have a block that uses inner blocks, you can even provide inner block data.\\n\\nThe following example is very basic, but it will give you an idea of how to provide inner block data. It can easily be reproduced with our `Carousel` block if you want to try it yourself.\\n\\n> If you don\'t have Carousel block in your project yet, you can add it with the following WP-CLI command: `wp boilerplate blocks use-block --name=\\"carousel\\"`\\n\\nOnce you have the `Carousel` block up and running, create a variation called `Carousel Loop`. For this variation, we want the following:\\n- loop\\n- pagination\\n- two images per slide\\n\\nWe will also add some placeholder images so you can immediately test the Carousel block variation. Here is the code you can add to the `manifest.json` file for that variation.\\n```json\\n{\\n\\t\\"$schema\\": \\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infinum/eightshift-frontend-libs/develop/schemas/variation.json\\",\\n\\t\\"parentName\\": \\"carousel\\",\\n\\t\\"name\\": \\"carousel-loop\\",\\n\\t\\"title\\": \\"Carousel Loop\\",\\n\\t\\"description\\" : \\"Carousel block variation with loop and pagination enabled, along with multiple image blocks with placeholders.

After adding it in the editor, the `Carousel` attributes will be already set to the ones you provided, as well as two images that are added as inner blocks.\\n\\n![Block list with variations](/img/blog/block-list-variations.png)"},{"id":"acf-in-a-project","metadata":{"permalink":"/autool/blog/acf-in-a-project","source":"@site/blog/2022-05-10-acf-in-a-project.md","title":"How to use ACF in your project","description":"Example of using ACF plugin in your project","date":"2022-05-17T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 17, 2022","tags":[{"label":"eightshift","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/eightshift"},{"label":"boilerplate","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/boilerplate"},{"label":"acf","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/acf"},{"label":"advanced custom fields","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/advanced-custom-fields"},{"label":"theme options","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/theme-options"}],"readingTime":5.465,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Igor Obradovi\u0107","title":"WordPress Engineer","url":"https://github.com/iobrado","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23059501?v=4","key":"obradovic"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"How to use ACF in your project","description":"Example of using ACF plugin in your project","slug":"acf-in-a-project","authors":"obradovic","date":"2022-05-17T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["eightshift","boilerplate","acf","advanced custom fields","theme options"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Block Variations","permalink":"/autool/blog/block-variations"},"nextItem":{"title":"Using assets in a project","permalink":"/autool/blog/using-assets"}},"content":"If you\'ve worked with WordPress for a long time, you\'ve heard of the **_Advanced Custom Fields_** plugin (**_ACF_** for short). While the use of blocks has simplified content editing, thus making meta fields less of a necessity, there are still cases in which meta fields are very useful.\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Ways of registering ACF fields\\n\\nThere are multiple approaches to ACF field registration. The easiest way to register fields is using the WP admin interface, but this approach has a few drawbacks. If you have many fields, this can impact performance because you are registering fields dynamically (information about registered fields is stored in the database). Another drawback is if you have multiple environments (e.g. local, staging, production), you\'ll have to export the fields and import them to other environments.\\n\\nOther ways of registering ACF fields are either via PHP (code) or by reading from a JSON file. We prefer to use PHP because you can use OPcache to speed up field registration even more. If you are using Git, this approach is even better because you can commit the PHP code used for registering fields for easier portability across different environments. For that reason, Eightshift Development kit already has some goodies which will make field registration a breeze.\\n\\n## Exporting PHP code\\n\\nThe approach we use for registering ACF fields is by adding those fields first through the WP Admin ACF interface. As an example, We\'ll add a field group called **_Intro_**, which will contain one text field of the same name. That field group will be displayed only on posts. You can add a few more fields, but for the sake of simplicity, we\'ll only use one field.\\n\\nWhen you define all the fields you need, save them and go to `Custom Fields -> Tools`. Here you will see an option to **_Export Field Groups_**. Simply select the field groups which you want to export and select **_Generate PHP_**.\\n\\n![ACF PHP code export](/img/blog/acf-generate-php.png)\\n\\nThis will generate a PHP code snippet that you can use in your theme. Now you may be wondering, where exactly should that code go?\\n\\n## CustomMeta class\\n\\nThose ACF goodies in Eightshift Development kit we talked about earlier? Let us introduce you to one of them. We have a WP CLI command which we can use to generate a CustomMeta class where we can add our field groups. The command is `wp boilerplate create_acf_meta`. This command has one required parameter, and that is `name`. To create a class that we will use for registering our custom fields, we\'ll use the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\nwp boilerplate create_acf_meta --name=intro\\n```\\n\\nThis command will generate a **_CustomMeta_** folder inside **_src_** folder and add a new file called **_IntroAcfMeta.php_**. Inside that file, you should see the following method:\\n```php\\npublic function fields(): void\\n{\\n\\tif (function_exists(\'acf_add_local_field_group\')) {\\n\\t\\t\\\\acf_add_local_field_group([]);\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nGo back to your PHP code export for ACF fields and select everything inside the `acf_add_local_field_group()` function and paste it into your function. To make it in line with our coding standards, we have to do the following:\\n- replace `array()` with `[]`\\n- make every label translatable and escaped - use `esc_html__()`\\n- instead of hardcoding the field name, replace it with a class constant\\n\\nAfter all these changes, your code should look like this:\\n\\n```php\\nclass IntroAcfMeta extends AbstractAcfMeta\\n{\\n\\n\\t/**\\n\\t * Intro field name.\\n\\t */\\n\\tpublic const INTRO_FIELD_NAME = \'intro\';\\n\\t\\n\\t/**\\n\\t * Render acf fields.\\n\\t *\\n\\t * @return void\\n\\t */\\n\\tpublic function fields(): void\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tif (function_exists(\'acf_add_local_field_group\')) {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\\\acf_add_local_field_group([\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\'key\' => \'group_6269300acefda\',\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\'title\' =>  \\\\esc_html__(\'Intro\', \'eightshift-theme\'),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\'fields\' => [\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t[\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\'key\' => \'field_6269300f8029b\',\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\'label\' => \\\\esc_html__(\'Intro\', \'eightshift-theme\'),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\'name\' => self::INTRO_FIELD_NAME,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\'type\' => \'text\',\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t// ...\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t// ...\\n\\t\\t\\t]);\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe final step is to go back to the Custom Fields in WP admin and either delete or deactivate your field group from there, to prevent registering the fields twice. After adding field definitions in PHP and removing them in WP admin, your field should be visible when editing posts.\\n\\n## Using get_field()\\n\\nTo fetch the saved meta value, we use ACF\'s `get_field()` function, but here are a few tips that could improve your code quality. First, you should check if that function exists. That way, if ACF is deactivated on your site for whatever reason, your site won\'t break. The second tip is to use a class constant instead of hardcoding the field name. With these practices in mind, your code should look like this:\\n\\n```php\\nuse YourNamespace\\\\CustomMeta\\\\IntroAcfMeta;\\n\\n// ...\\n\\nif (function_exists(\'get_field\')) {\\n\\t$introText = get_field(IntroAcfMeta::INTRO_FIELD_NAME, $postId);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n> It\'s better to use class constants because if you decide to change the field name, you will have to change it only in one place.\\n\\n## Theme Options\\n\\nACF\'s Options page has a wide array of uses and it\'s very likely that you\'ll need some sort of Theme Options in your project. To make the implementation of Theme Options a bit easier, we have a CLI command which generates the `ThemeOptions` class in your project. Just use the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\nwp boilerplate create_theme_options\\n```\\n\\nThis command generates a class with two methods. The first one, `createThemeOptionsPage()` creates a Theme Options page and adds it to the WP Admin sidebar. The second one, `registerThemeOptions()`, is what registers the fields you will have in Theme Options. Here is an example how Theme Options look after being created using `wp boilerplate`:\\n\\n![ACF Theme Options](/img/blog/acf-theme-options.png)\\n\\nTo add fields to your Theme Options, follow the steps from the **_Exporting PHP code_** section of this post and add the fields inside the `\'fields\' => []` array.\\n## Tip - create a helper class\\n\\nIn this blog post, we covered the whole process of registering and using ACF fields in your project. But, if you are using a lot of ACF fields, wrapping each `get_field()` function with a `function_exists()` conditional may become tedious at some point. For that reason, it may be a good idea to create a helper class that you can use for ACF functions.\\n\\nI won\'t cover the whole process in detail, but I\'ll give you some general pointers.\\n\\n- when registering plugin-related classes, use the `Plugins` namespace. In this case, you should have namespace `YourNamespace\\\\Plugins\\\\Acf`\\n- inside that namespace, you can create a class called `AcfHelper`\\n- add a method `getField` which accepts the same arguments as the `get_field()` function\\n- add a method `getThemeOption` which only accepts one argument, the field name, and the second argument is hardcoded\\n- use early returns in your methods\\n```php\\nif (!function_exists(\'get_field\')) {\\n\\treturn \'\';\\n}\\n```"},{"id":"using-assets","metadata":{"permalink":"/autool/blog/using-assets","source":"@site/blog/2022-04-25-using-assets.md","title":"Using assets in a project","description":"Step-by-step guide on how to add assets like images or icons to your theme.","date":"2022-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 28, 2022","tags":[{"label":"eightshift","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/eightshift"},{"label":"boilerplate","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/boilerplate"},{"label":"assets","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/assets"},{"label":"images","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/images"},{"label":"icons","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/icons"}],"readingTime":3.91,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Igor Obradovi\u0107","title":"WordPress Engineer","url":"https://github.com/iobrado","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23059501?v=4","key":"obradovic"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Using assets in a project","description":"Step-by-step guide on how to add assets like images or icons to your theme.","slug":"using-assets","authors":"obradovic","date":"2022-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["eightshift","boilerplate","assets","images","icons"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"How to use ACF in your project","permalink":"/autool/blog/acf-in-a-project"},"nextItem":{"title":"Adding fonts","permalink":"/autool/blog/adding-fonts"}},"content":"Previously, we went through the process of adding fonts to your project. While the process of adding additional assets like images or icons has some similarities to adding fonts, it also has its unique steps. In this post, we\'ll cover multiple ways of adding assets and using them on your site.\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Adding images\\n\\nSimilar to fonts, there is also a dedicated folder for adding images that will be used in a theme. The location of this folder is **_assets/images_**. The procedure to add images is even simpler than fonts, which you can read about in [Adding fonts](/blog/adding-fonts) blog post. Just follow these steps to add a new image:\\n- add the image in inside **_assets/images_** folder\\n- include it in **_assets/images/index.js_**\\n- run `npm start` to rebuild assets\\n\\nThe new image will now be available in the **_public_** folder. The use case for this is adding a favicon or a logo to your project. To use this image in one of your templates or blocks, you have to add the following in your **_php_** file:\\n\\n```php\\nuse YourNamespace\\\\Manifest\\\\Manifest;\\n// ...\\n\\napply_filters(Manifest::MANIFEST_ITEM, \'logo.svg\');\\n```\\n\\nThe filter we are using is called `manifest-item` and we use it to get the URL of the asset from the **_public_** folder. You can read more about this in [our documentation](/docs/basics/manifest).\\n\\nYou can see how this is being used for rendering both favicon and header logo in your theme\'s **_header.php_** file.\\n\\n> **Tip**: Don\'t hardcode the filter name in the `apply_filters` function. Always call it via class constants.\\n\\nFor better organization, you can add additional folders (e.g. **_icons_**, **_placeholders_**) inside the **_assets/images_** folder. Here\'s an example of how to include them:\\n\\n```js\\n// Icons\\nimport \'./icons/upload.svg\';\\n\\n// Placeholders\\nimport \'./placeholders/post.png\';\\nimport \'./placeholders/page.png\';\\n```\\n\\n## Using SVG files from manifest\\n\\nIf you recall from a previous blog post about you might have already seen an alternative approach to including SVG files in your block or component.\\n\\n> If you don\'t have it in your project, be sure to read our blog post about adding blocks and components by using [WP CLI](/blog/adding-blocks-wpcli).\\n\\nOpen **_src/Blocks/components/quote/manifest.json_** and you\'ll see that the icon used by the component is defined inside `resources` as a key-value pair. Key represents the name that we will use to fetch the icon, while the value is SVG code.\\n\\n```json\\n\\"resources\\": {\\n\\t\\"icon\\": \\"<svg fill=\'none\' height=\'24\' viewBox=\'0 0 24 24\' width=\'24\' xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\'>...</svg>\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn order to make the minification of SVG files as easy as possible, our teammate Goran made an awesome tool called [SVG2WP](https://svg-2-wp.goranalkovic.com/). Some of the options include making attributes JSX compatible, or replacing the color value with `currentColor`, which can then be used to change the SVG color through CSS.\\n\\nYou\'ve already seen the use of `currentColor` in the above-mentioned blog post, where we\'ve modified the color of the SVG.\\n\\nThe output of the icon on frontend is very simple. In the Quote component, it was done the following way:\\n```php\\n<?php $manifest = Components::getManifest(__DIR__); ?>\\n\\n<i class=\\"<?php echo \\\\esc_attr(\\"{$componentClass}__icon\\"); ?>\\">\\n\\t<?php echo $manifest[\'resources\'][\'icon\']; // phpcs:ignore Eightshift.Security.ComponentsEscape.OutputNotEscaped ?>\\n</i>\\n```\\n\\nAn excellent example, where you can see in even more detail how SVGs are being used, is our `icon` component. It isn\'t included in Eightshift theme by default, so you have to add it to your project with WP CLI. To include it in your project, use the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\nwp boilerplate use_component --name=icon\\n```\\n\\nIf you include the Icon component inside a block, you will have the option to choose between multiple icons defined in the manifest. Another way to render SVGs from the Icon component is by using the `Components::render` helper method:\\n\\n```php\\necho Components::render(\\n\\t\'icon\',\\n\\t[\\n\\t\\t\'blockClass\' => $componentClass,\\n\\t\\t\'iconName\' => \'download\',\\n\\t]\\n);\\n```\\n\\nHere are some examples of icons available out-of-the-box in our Icon component:\\n\\n![Icon component](/img/blog/icon-component.png)\\n\\n## Using icons for editor and block options\\n\\nWhen developing your blocks and adding new options, you may need to add icons to improve the user experience. We have many icons already available for use. You can see the full list in our [Storybook](/storybook) under `Editor -> Icons` section. We already added the icon when adding a new Color Theme option for the Quote block. Here is the simplified version:\\n```jsx\\nimport { ColorPaletteCustom, IconLabel, icons } from \'@eightshift/frontend-libs/scripts\';\\n\\nreturn (\\n\\t<ColorPaletteCustom\\n\\t\\tlabel={<IconLabel icon={icons.color} label={__(\'Color Theme\', \'es-theme\')} />}\\n\\t\\t// ...\\n\\t/>\\n);\\n```\\n\\nThis was the end result when we were adding a new option in our Quote block:\\n\\n![Color Theme Options](/img/blog/color-theme-options.png)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAs you could see in this blog post, there are multiple ways of adding assets to a project. It all depends on how these will be used and what the scope of their use will be."},{"id":"adding-fonts","metadata":{"permalink":"/autool/blog/adding-fonts","source":"@site/blog/2022-04-08-adding-fonts.md","title":"Adding fonts","description":"An intro to adding fonts to your project.","date":"2022-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 12, 2022","tags":[{"label":"eightshift","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/eightshift"},{"label":"boilerplate","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/boilerplate"},{"label":"fonts","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/fonts"}],"readingTime":5.985,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Igor Obradovi\u0107","title":"WordPress Engineer","url":"https://github.com/iobrado","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23059501?v=4","key":"obradovic"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Adding fonts","description":"An intro to adding fonts to your project.","slug":"adding-fonts","authors":"obradovic","date":"2022-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["eightshift","boilerplate","fonts"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Using assets in a project","permalink":"/autool/blog/using-assets"},"nextItem":{"title":"Modifying blocks - Color Theme","permalink":"/autool/blog/modifying-blocks-color-theme"}},"content":"Every project is unique. Logo, colors, fonts, etc. are what define the visual identity of your website. In this post, we\'ll cover adding fonts to a project.\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Importing fonts into your project\\nOur documentation covers the necessary steps to add a font to your project, but here we\'ll cover the process in a bit more detail. To start, we need a font (or two). For this example, I\'ll use **_Source Sans Pro_** and **_Noto Serif_** which I\'ve downloaded from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). They are in the `.ttf` format (you may find some which are `.otf`, which will work in the same way), so you need to convert them to `.woff` and `.woff2`. Whatever approach you use is okay - we recommend the following tools:\\n- [Convertio](https://convertio.co/ttf-woff/)\\n- [Cloud Convert](https://cloudconvert.com/ttf-to-woff)\\n- [Everything Fonts](https://everythingfonts.com/ttf-to-woff)\\n- [Transfonter](https://transfonter.org/)\\n\\n> Just make sure you have the proper license for the fonts you are converting.\\n\\nFonts should go inside your theme\'s **_/assets/fonts_** folder. Copy the fonts you want to use there. You will also notice that this folder contains an **_index.js_** file, used to import fonts into your project. Here\'s an example of how I imported my fonts:\\n```js\\n// SourceSansPro WOFF\\nimport \'./SourceSansPro-Bold.woff\';\\nimport \'./SourceSansPro-BoldItalic.woff\';\\nimport \'./SourceSansPro-Italic.woff\';\\nimport \'./SourceSansPro-Regular.woff\';\\nimport \'./SourceSansPro-Light.woff\';\\nimport \'./SourceSansPro-LightItalic.woff\';\\n\\n// SourceSansPro WOFF2\\nimport \'./SourceSansPro-Bold.woff2\';\\nimport \'./SourceSansPro-BoldItalic.woff2\';\\nimport \'./SourceSansPro-Italic.woff2\';\\nimport \'./SourceSansPro-Regular.woff2\';\\nimport \'./SourceSansPro-Light.woff2\';\\nimport \'./SourceSansPro-LightItalic.woff2\';\\n\\n// NotoSerif WOFF\\nimport \'./NotoSerif-Bold.woff\';\\nimport \'./NotoSerif-BoldItalic.woff\';\\nimport \'./NotoSerif-Italic.woff\';\\nimport \'./NotoSerif-Regular.woff\';\\n\\n// NotoSerif WOFF2\\nimport \'./NotoSerif-Bold.woff2\';\\nimport \'./NotoSerif-BoldItalic.woff2\';\\nimport \'./NotoSerif-Italic.woff2\';\\nimport \'./NotoSerif-Regular.woff2\';\\n```\\n\\n> If you don\'t need to support IE11, don\'t include `.woff` files. This will save you some bandwidth.\\n\\nTo add these fonts as your base font and secondary font, go to the global manifest located in **_/src/Blocks_** and add the following inside `globalVariables`:\\n```json\\n\\"globalVariables\\": {\\n\\t// ...\\n\\t\\"baseFont\\": \\"SourceSansPro\\",\\n\\t\\"secondaryFont\\": \\"NotoSerif\\",\\n\\t// ...\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNext, you can create a new file called **__typography.scss_** inside your **_/assets/styles/parts/utils/_** folder and add the following:\\n\\n```scss\\n@include font-face(global-settings(baseFont), \'SourceSansPro-Light\', 300);\\n@include font-face(global-settings(baseFont), \'SourceSansPro-LightItalic\', 300, italic);\\n@include font-face(global-settings(baseFont), \'SourceSansPro-Regular\', 400);\\n@include font-face(global-settings(baseFont), \'SourceSansPro-Italic\', 400, italic);\\n@include font-face(global-settings(baseFont), \'SourceSansPro-Bold\', 700);\\n@include font-face(global-settings(baseFont), \'SourceSansPro-BoldItalic\', 700, italic);\\n\\n@include font-face(global-settings(secondaryFont), \'NotoSerif-Bold\', 700);\\n@include font-face(global-settings(secondaryFont), \'NotoSerif-BoldItalic\', 700, italic);\\n@include font-face(global-settings(secondaryFont), \'NotoSerif-Italic\', 400, italic);\\n@include font-face(global-settings(secondaryFont), \'NotoSerif-Regular\', 400);\\n```\\nIf you would like to know more about the `font-face` mixin, you can take a look at our [Sass documentation](/sass).\\n\\nBecause this is a new file, we have to include it. You can do that inside **_/assets/styles/parts/\\\\_shared.scss_** file:\\n```scss\\n// Project specific.\\n@import \'utils/shared-variables\';\\n@import \'utils/typography\';\\n```\\n\\nRun `npm start` to rebuild your **_public_** folder and assets. If you did everything correctly, your build should pass and you will see your fonts inside the **_public_** folder.\\n\\n## Using only one font in a block\\n\\nThere are multiple ways of using fonts in a block. The simplest use case is if you have only one font you want to use for that specific block. In this case, we want the Heading block to only use _Noto Serif_.\\n\\nTo make our secondary font available for use, we need to first define it as a CSS variable. We can do that in **_/assets/styles/parts/utils/\\\\_shared-variables.scss_**. The base font is already defined there, so all we need to do is add our secondary font definition below it.\\n\\nTo make things a bit more consistent, we may also want to rename `--global-font-family` CSS variable to `--base-font-family`. Just don\'t forget to search/replace this new variable name across your project! Please note that the fallbacks for the fonts can be anything, this is just an example. Once we\'re done, it should look like this:\\n```scss\\n\\t--base-font-family: var(--global-base-font), -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \'Segoe UI\', Roboto, Helvetica,\\n\\t\\tArial, sans-serif, \'Apple Color Emoji\', \'Segoe UI Emoji\', \'Segoe UI Symbol\';\\n\\n\\t--secondary-font-family: var(--global-secondary-font), -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \'Segoe UI\', Roboto, Helvetica,\\n\\t\\tArial, sans-serif, \'Apple Color Emoji\', \'Segoe UI Emoji\', \'Segoe UI Symbol\';\\n```\\nAfter defining the `--secondary-font-family` CSS variable, we can go to **_/src/Blocks/components/heading/heading-style.scss_** and add the following rule to the `.heading` class:\\n```scss\\n\\tfont-family: var(--secondary-font-family);\\n```\\n\\nAnd that\'s it! The Heading block will now use the _Noto Serif_ font.\\n\\n## Adding a font picker\\n\\nIn some cases, you may want to give users the option to choose between fonts that they want to use in their block. For this example, we\'ll use the `paragraph` block where we want users to have both _Source Sans Pro_ and _Noto Serif_ available.\\n\\nFirst step is to add a new attribute, options and CSS variable values in **_/src/Blocks/components/paragraph/manifest.json_**:\\n```json\\n// ...\\n\\t\\"attributes\\": {\\n\\t\\t// ...\\n\\t\\t\\"paragraphFontFamily\\": {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\"type\\": \\"string\\",\\n\\t\\t\\t\\"default\\": \\"base\\"\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t},\\n\\t\\"options\\": {\\n\\t\\t// ...\\n\\t\\t\\"paragraphFontFamily\\": [\\n\\t\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\"label\\": \\"SourceSansPro\\",\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\"value\\": \\"base\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\"label\\": \\"NotoSerif\\",\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\"value\\": \\"secondary\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t],\\n\\t\\t// ...\\n\\t}\\n```\\n\\nAfter defining the new attribute and options for the font family, we now have to add a variable to **_manifest.json_**. We can add it to the `variables` object. This approach is slightly different from the one explained in the blog post. Here we can use `%value%` wildcard to dynamically add the selected value to our CSS variable.\\n```json\\n\\"paragraphFontFamily\\": [\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\"variable\\": {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\"paragraph-font-family\\": \\"var(--%value%-font-family)\\"\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n]\\n```\\n\\nThe next step is to go to **_/src/Blocks/components/paragraph/components/paragraph-options.js_** and add a control for the new font family option. The first thing we can add is a new attribute that will allow us to toggle showing the Paragraph font family option on other blocks which are using the Paragraph component. There might be a case where we want only one font family, so this option may come in handy in some other blocks.\\n```js\\nconst {\\n\\t\\tsetAttributes,\\n\\t\\t//...\\n\\t\\tshowParagraphFontFamily = true,\\n\\t} = attributes;\\n```\\n\\nAfter that, we need to fetch either the saved attribute value or get the default one from the manifest. We can do that with the `checkAttr` helper, adding it just below `paragraphColor` and `paragraphSize`.\\n```js\\n\\tconst paragraphFontFamily = checkAttr(\'paragraphFontFamily\', attributes, manifest);\\n```\\n\\nNow we have to add an actual control to the options panel which will allow us to choose between fonts.\\n```js\\n\\treturn (\\n\\t\\t// ...\\n\\t\\t{showParagraphFontFamily &&\\n\\t\\t\\t<CustomSelect\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlabel={<IconLabel icon={icons.fontFamily} label={__(\'Font Family\', \'eightshift-theme\')} />}\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvalue={paragraphFontFamily}\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toptions={getOption(\'paragraphFontFamily\', attributes, manifest)}\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonChange={(value) => setAttributes({ [getAttrKey(\'paragraphFontFamily\', attributes, manifest)]: value })}\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tisClearable={false}\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tisSearchable={false}\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsimpleValue\\n\\t\\t\\t/>\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t// ...\\n\\t);\\n```\\n\\nThe control for selecting a font should now be available under Paragraph options. Saving the choice now works, but the font stays the same both in the editor and on the frontend.\\n\\n![Font Picker](/img/blog/font-picker.png)\\n\\nThe final step we need to make this work is to add a CSS rule that consumes our variable to **_/src/Blocks/components/paragraph/paragraph-style.scss_**:\\n```scss\\n.paragraph {\\n\\t// ...\\n\\tfont-family: var(--paragraph-font-family, var(--base-font-family));\\n\\t// ...\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAfter adding this single line of CSS code, your new option for selecting fonts will now be fully functional.\\n\\n## Closing thoughts\\nAdding fonts to a project is something you will usually only do when setting up a new project and then forget about it. As you could see in this blog post, this isn\'t a complicated process, but it has a specific set of steps that have to be taken in order for custom fonts to work in your project.\\n\\nOf course, there are other ways to include fonts in your project, but the described process is what we recommend and use. This is the (Eightshift) Way."},{"id":"modifying-blocks-color-theme","metadata":{"permalink":"/autool/blog/modifying-blocks-color-theme","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-04-modifying-blocks.md","title":"Modifying blocks - Color Theme","description":"Step-by-step guide on how to modify and expand the functionality of existing blocks.","date":"2022-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 22, 2022","tags":[{"label":"eightshift","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/eightshift"},{"label":"boilerplate","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/boilerplate"},{"label":"components","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/components"},{"label":"blocks","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/blocks"}],"readingTime":8.45,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Igor Obradovi\u0107","title":"WordPress Engineer","url":"https://github.com/iobrado","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23059501?v=4","key":"obradovic"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Modifying blocks - Color Theme","description":"Step-by-step guide on how to modify and expand the functionality of existing blocks.","slug":"modifying-blocks-color-theme","authors":"obradovic","date":"2022-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["eightshift","boilerplate","components","blocks"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Adding fonts","permalink":"/autool/blog/adding-fonts"},"nextItem":{"title":"Adding components and blocks with WP-CLI","permalink":"/autool/blog/adding-blocks-wpcli"}},"content":"In our previous post, we covered how to use Storybook and WP-CLI to add additional blocks to your project. This post will walk you through modifying an existing block step-by-step.\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nSince Eightshift Development kit is a starter theme, made for developers to jumpstart and speed up their development, you\'re welcome to modify files in it directly. There is no need to create a child theme to protect changes from updates.\\n\\n## Modifying a block or a component?\\nBecause we used the Quote block in our previous post, we will continue using it as an example as it\'s a fairly simple one. One of the first questions you may ask yourself could be: \\"Should I modify a component or a block?\\". And the answer is - it depends.\\n\\nIf you compare **_components/quote/quote.php_** (component) and **_custom/quote/quote.php_** (block), you\'ll notice that most of the HTML code is inside the component, while the block pretty much only renders the Quote component inside a wrapper. This example will walk you through the whole process of adding a new attribute and its options to a block.\\n\\n## What will we do?\\n\\nWe want to style the block and add a new feature. An option to choose a color theme for the Quote block. These are the specs:\\n- each Quote block has a background with rounded corners\\n- option for three color themes: blue, green, yellow\\n- the background has a lighter shade of the selected color\\n- quote icon has a stronger shade of the selected color\\n\\nTo better help you visualize, this is how the Quote block should look like after making these changes, showcasing all three color theme variations:\\n![Color Theme Examples](/img/blog/color-theme-examples.png)\\n\\n## Adding background\\n\\nInitial background styling is fairly straightforward. Navigate to **_src/Blocks/components/quote/quote-style.scss_** and paste the following code inside `.quote` class:\\n\\n```css\\npadding: calc(var(--base-font-size) * 1.6rem);\\nborder-radius: calc(var(--base-font-size) * 2rem);\\nbackground-color: global-settings(colors, light);\\n```\\nYou may notice we\'re using `calc` instead of directly writing values in rems. This way makes it much easier to calculate pixel size since `calc(var(--base-font-size) * 1.6rem)` equals `16px`.\\n\\nFor now, we will add a simple light grey background to see how it looks. We\'ll replace this value later with a CSS variable.\\n>**Tip:** don\'t hardcode hex color values directly inside your component. Instead, use colors defined in your global manifest.\\n\\nYou\'ll notice that the changes are visible both in the editor and on the frontend. Since the Gutenberg editor adds some additional markup, sometimes you\'ll need to add additional styling only for the editor. In case we need to override something in the editor for our Quote component, we would simply create **_quote-editor.scss_**.\\n\\n## Adding new colors to your project\\n\\nBecause the theme currently doesn\'t have all the required colors, we need to add additional colors which will be used for the color theme feature. We will use the colors already defined in the manifest for icon color, but we need to add lighter variations of those colors to use them for the background. Navigate to your global manifest, which is located inside **_src/Blocks/manifest.json_** and add the following values inside `colors`:\\n```json\\n{\\n\\t\\"name\\": \\"Light Blue\\",\\n\\t\\"slug\\": \\"light-blue\\",\\n\\t\\"color\\": \\"#B3E5FC\\"\\n},\\n{\\n\\t\\"name\\": \\"Light Green\\",\\n\\t\\"slug\\": \\"light-green\\",\\n\\t\\"color\\": \\"#DCEDC8\\"\\n},\\n{\\n\\t\\"name\\": \\"Light Yellow\\",\\n\\t\\"slug\\": \\"light-yellow\\",\\n\\t\\"color\\": \\"#FFF9C4\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Adding a new attribute and options to manifest\\n\\nFor editors to be able to choose which color theme to use for the Quote block, we need to define an attribute for it in the manifest. Navigate to **_src/Blocks/components/quote/manifest.json_** and add the following value inside `attributes`:\\n\\n```json\\n\\"quoteColorTheme\\": {\\n\\t\\"type\\": \\"string\\",\\n\\t\\"default\\": \\"blue\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n> Double-check the path of the manifest used in this example. We\'re adding it inside the Quote component manifest, not the Quote block manifest. \\n\\nAfter that, since we want to have a fixed number of options, we need to define available options. We can do that inside `options` which is on the same level as `attributes`:\\n```json\\n\\"options\\": {\\n\\t\\"quoteColorTheme\\": [\\n\\t\\t\\"blue\\",\\n\\t\\t\\"green\\",\\n\\t\\t\\"yellow\\"\\n\\t]\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## CSS variables\\n\\nOur next step is to add CSS variables to the Quote component\'s manifest. Inside **_manifest.json_**, on the same level as `attributes`, add the following code:\\n```json\\n\\"variables\\": {\\n\\t\\"quoteColorTheme\\": {\\n\\t\\t\\"blue\\": [\\n\\t\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\"variable\\": {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\"quote-background-color\\": \\"var(--global-colors-light-blue)\\",\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\"quote-icon-color\\": \\"var(--global-colors-blue)\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t],\\n\\t\\t\\"green\\": [\\n\\t\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\"variable\\": {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\"quote-background-color\\": \\"var(--global-colors-light-green)\\",\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\"quote-icon-color\\": \\"var(--global-colors-green)\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t],\\n\\t\\t\\"yellow\\": [\\n\\t\\t\\t{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\"variable\\": {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\"quote-background-color\\": \\"var(--global-colors-light-yellow)\\",\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\"quote-icon-color\\": \\"var(--global-colors-yellow)\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t]\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow, navigate back to Quote component\'s **_quote-style.scss_** and replace the `background-color` which we used for testing with the following:\\n```css\\nbackground-color: var(--quote-background-color);\\n```\\n\\nAs you can see, the variable name is the same one we used when defining background color variations in the manifest. For icon color, we do the same. After adding a new color to `&__icon` selector, our code should now look like this:\\n\\n```css\\n&__icon {\\n\\tdisplay: block;\\n\\tmargin-bottom: 1rem;\\n\\tcolor: var(--quote-icon-color);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Outputting CSS variables in editor\\nTo make our color theme visible in editor, we have to add few lines of code to **_src/Blocks/components/quote/components/quote-editor.js_** file. First, we need to import a few functions. We need `useMemo` from **_react_**, `outputCssVariables` and `getUnique` from **_@eightshift/frontend-libs/scripts_** and finally, we need data from the global manifest.\\n\\nAfter importing these and defining a unique constant, your code should look like this:\\n\\n```js\\nimport React, { useMemo } from \'react\';\\nimport classnames from \'classnames\';\\nimport { checkAttr, props, selector, outputCssVariables, getUnique } from \'@eightshift/frontend-libs/scripts\';\\nimport { HeadingEditor } from \'../../heading/components/heading-editor\';\\nimport { ParagraphEditor } from \'../../paragraph/components/paragraph-editor\';\\nimport manifest from \'./../manifest.json\';\\nimport globalManifest from \'./../../../manifest.json\';\\n\\nexport const QuoteEditor = (attributes) => {\\n\\tconst unique = useMemo(() => getUnique(), []);\\n\\t//...\\n```\\nNext, we need to add a unique `data-id` and output the `<style>` tag containing CSS variables.\\n\\nModify your return statement so it looks like this:\\n\\n```jsx\\nreturn (\\n\\t<>\\n\\t\\t<figure className={quoteClass} data-id={unique}>\\n\\t\\t\\t{outputCssVariables(attributes, manifest, unique, globalManifest)}\\n\\t\\t\\t//...\\n```\\n\\nIf you try adding a Quote block in the editor, you should notice that it now has a light blue background with a quote icon in a darker shade of blue. This is the default value for the `quoteColorTheme` attribute we added in the component\'s manifest.\\n\\n## Outputting CSS variables in the PHP template\\nThe PHP template for the Quote component is located in **_src/Blocks/components/quote/quote.php_**. This process is similar to the one described above, it\'s just written in PHP. All helper methods we need for this are contained inside the `Components` class, which is already included in this file.\\n\\nSimilar to the JS template, we need a unique value, assign it to `data-id`, and output CSS variables. After adding these, the code should look like this:\\n\\n```php\\n<?php\\n//...\\n$quoteClass = Components::classnames([\\n\\tComponents::selector($componentClass, $componentClass),\\n\\tComponents::selector($blockClass, $blockClass, $selectorClass),\\n\\tComponents::selector($additionalClass, $additionalClass),\\n]);\\n\\n$unique = Components::getUnique();\\n?>\\n\\n<figure class=\\"<?php echo \\\\esc_attr($quoteClass); ?>\\" data-id=\\"<?php echo \\\\esc_attr($unique); ?>\\">\\n\\t<?php echo Components::outputCssVariables($attributes, $manifest, $unique, $globalManifest); ?>\\n\\t//...\\n```\\n\\n> Both PHP and JS have the same helpers to make writing code for editor and front view as similar as possible.\\n\\n## Adding options\\nAfter adding these snippets, you should already see that your block is using the blue color theme, which we defined as the default value for `quoteColorTheme` in the manifest. We want to have an easy way to change the color theme in the editor. Now we\'ll add a new option which will do just that.\\n\\nWe will add these options in **_src/Blocks/components/quote/components/quote-options.js_**. Again, we will start with the imports we will need. First one is `__` from **_@wordpress/i18n_** package. Additional imports we need are from **_@eightshift/frontend-libs/scripts_**, so we will just add those to the list.\\n```js\\nimport { __ } from \'@wordpress/i18n\';\\nimport {\\n\\t//...\\n\\tColorPaletteCustom,\\n\\tIconLabel,\\n\\ticons,\\n\\tgetOption\\n} from \'@eightshift/frontend-libs/scripts\';\\n```\\n\\nNext, we can add a new attribute in options called `showQuoteColorTheme` and set it to `true` by default. If we want to use this component in other blocks, we can use this attribute for showing or hiding Color Theme Options on a specific block that uses the Quote component.\\n\\nAdditionally, we need to get values for `quoteUse` and `quoteColorTheme` attributes. We can use the `checkAttr` helper which first checks if a block has saved attribute value. If not, it defaults to a value defined in the manifest.\\n\\n```js\\nexport const QuoteOptions = (attributes) => {\\n\\t//...\\n\\tconst {\\n\\t\\tsetAttributes,\\n\\t\\t//...\\n\\t\\tshowQuoteColorTheme = true,\\n\\t} = attributes;\\n\\t//...\\n\\tconst quoteUse = checkAttr(\'quoteUse\', attributes, manifest);\\n\\tconst quoteColorTheme = checkAttr(\'quoteColorTheme\', attributes, manifest);\\n```\\n\\nFinally, we add the Color Palette, which we will use for switching color themes.\\n\\n```js\\nreturn (\\n\\t<>\\n\\t\\t//...\\n\\n\\t\\t{quoteUse &&\\n\\t\\t\\t<>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t{showQuoteColorTheme &&\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<ColorPaletteCustom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlabel={<IconLabel icon={icons.color} label={__(\'Color Theme\', \'es-theme\')} />}\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcolors={getOption(\'quoteColorTheme\', attributes, manifest, true)}\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tvalue={quoteColorTheme}\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tonChange={(value) => setAttributes({ [getAttrKey(\'quoteColorTheme\', attributes, manifest)]: value })}\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t/>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t\\t//...\\n```\\n\\nThe Color Theme option should now be visible and fully functional inside the Quote block.\\n\\n![Color Theme Options](/img/blog/color-theme-options.png)\\n\\n## Adding transitions in the editor\\n\\nThe options work, but you may notice there is no transition in the editor. It is not necessary but will improve the user experience. Since we do not need transition effects on the frontend, we can add these CSS rules only to the editor. To do that, we start by creating **_quote-editor.scss_** file inside **_src/Blocks/components/quote_** folder.\\n\\nWe add the following CSS:\\n```css\\n.quote {\\n\\ttransition: background-color 0.3s ease-in-out;\\n\\n\\t&__icon {\\n\\t\\ttransition: color 0.3s ease-in-out;\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nBecause we\'ve added a new file, we have to run `npm start` again. Now the transition between colors will be much smoother.\\n\\n![Color Theme Change](/img/blog/color-theme-change.gif)\\n\\n## Closing thoughts\\n\\nIn this post, we\'ve covered the whole process of adding a new attribute. It involves a lot of steps and things to keep in mind, but once you get used to it, you\'ll be able to add quite powerful features to your blocks.\\n\\nOne more important thing to keep in mind is the expandability of your attributes. When adding new attributes, don\'t think just about what you need now, keep in mind that you may need to expand it later.\\n\\nThe way we built Color Theme functionality makes adding additional color themes a breeze and can be done in a matter of minutes. For \\"homework\\", try adding two more color themes of your choice. Good luck!"},{"id":"adding-blocks-wpcli","metadata":{"permalink":"/autool/blog/adding-blocks-wpcli","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-03-adding-blocks-wpcli.md","title":"Adding components and blocks with WP-CLI","description":"This blog post covers how to use our WP CLI commands for adding components and blocks into your project.","date":"2022-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 14, 2022","tags":[{"label":"eightshift","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/eightshift"},{"label":"boilerplate","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/boilerplate"},{"label":"wpcli","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/wpcli"},{"label":"components","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/components"},{"label":"blocks","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/blocks"}],"readingTime":2.735,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Igor Obradovi\u0107","title":"WordPress Engineer","url":"https://github.com/iobrado","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23059501?v=4","key":"obradovic"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Adding components and blocks with WP-CLI","description":"This blog post covers how to use our WP CLI commands for adding components and blocks into your project.","slug":"adding-blocks-wpcli","authors":"obradovic","date":"2022-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["eightshift","boilerplate","wpcli","components","blocks"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Modifying blocks - Color Theme","permalink":"/autool/blog/modifying-blocks-color-theme"},"nextItem":{"title":"Components and blocks","permalink":"/autool/blog/components-and-blocks"}},"content":"Although there are a few basic blocks available after creating a project, there are a lot more blocks available in the dev kit. However, you have to add them to your project using WP-CLI (the simplest method). To see the complete list of available components and blocks, visit our [Storybook](/storybook). \\n\\nThese can be used out-of-the-box, but also as a good starting point if you need similar blocks in your projects. It will also speed up your development time since you don\'t have to build everything from scratch.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n> _**Last updated: 23rd August, 2022**_\\n\\n## Storybook\\n\\nStorybook allows you to preview how the components and blocks look and which options they have available. Since Storybook is interactive, you can try out most of the options. Think of it as a catalog with all custom blocks we\'ve built and made ready for public use.\\n\\nEach entry in Storybook should have documentation that explains the block in more detail, along with implementation instructions. Before using any block, be sure to check `Dependencies` section. Although `Implementation` section lists all the necessary WP-CLI commands required to use a specific block or a component, it is recommended to check if you have the required dependencies ready in your theme.\\n\\n## WP-CLI commands\\n\\nIf you\'ve read our [Initial Setup](/blog/initial-setup) post, you\'re already familiar with our custom WP-CLI commands. For implementing additional components, we have `wp boilerplate blocks use-component --name=` command. For blocks, we have `wp boilerplate blocks use-block --name=` command.\\n\\n## Adding new component and block in our project\\n\\nLet\'s say we need a Quote block in our project. After going through the documentation of the Quote block, we see that we have one dependency, and that is the Quote component. So, to make Quote block available in our project, we need two WP-CLI commands:\\n\\n```bash\\nwp boilerplate blocks use-block --name=quote\\nwp boilerplate blocks use-component --name=quote\\n```\\n\\nWhen entering the `wp boilerplate blocks use-block --name=\'quote\'` command, you\'ll notice the note about a block dependency on the Quote component. So you should run the second command as well.\\n\\n![Setup - instructions](/img/blog/wpcli-1.png)\\n\\nAfter entering these commands, run `npm start` again to make sure everything works properly.\\n\\nThe Quote block is now ready to use and available in your blocks list. You may use it as-is, or you may want to expand its functionalities with some additional attributes. More about that will be covered in the next blog post.\\n\\n## Using Example block\\n\\nIf you want to build a block almost from scratch, you can use our Example block. This is a very simple block that generates all necessary files with some example options. To add an Example block to your project, use the following WP-CLI command:\\n\\n```bash\\nwp boilerplate blocks use-block --name=example\\n```\\n\\nSince our blocks use a predefined structure to make everything register automatically, adding Example block with WP-CLI will generate all required files. After it\'s added, feel free to rename the folder, as well as files with the name of your block and start modifying all the files. Simply replace \\"example\\" with the name of your block.\\n\\n## Further reading\\n\\nOur documentation has all this covered in a lot more detail, so if you would like to better understand the structure of our blocks and components, here are some chapters covering these topics:"},{"id":"components-and-blocks","metadata":{"permalink":"/autool/blog/components-and-blocks","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-21-components-and-blocks.md","title":"Components and blocks","description":"Explanation of the difference between components and blocks on a practical example","date":"2022-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 21, 2022","tags":[{"label":"eightshift","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/eightshift"},{"label":"boilerplate","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/boilerplate"},{"label":"components","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/components"},{"label":"blocks","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/blocks"}],"readingTime":3.73,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Igor Obradovi\u0107","title":"WordPress Engineer","url":"https://github.com/iobrado","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23059501?v=4","key":"obradovic"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Components and blocks","description":"Explanation of the difference between components and blocks on a practical example","slug":"components-and-blocks","authors":"obradovic","tags":["eightshift","boilerplate","components","blocks"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Adding components and blocks with WP-CLI","permalink":"/autool/blog/adding-blocks-wpcli"},"nextItem":{"title":"Initial setup and first steps","permalink":"/autool/blog/initial-setup"}},"content":"In this blog post, we\'ll give you a practical explanation about the difference between components and blocks. For a truly in-depth explanation about components and blocks, you can refer to our documentation. A more specific explanation about using components in a block can be found in the Component in a Block section.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\nOne of the things that is really confusing to newcomers is the difference between components and blocks. Let\'s break it all down.\\n\\n## Component\\n\\n> A component is like a blank slate, a template without context.\\n\\nIt doesn\'t know or even care for what it will be used. Can you combine multiple simple components into one complex component? Absolutely! That\'s exactly what we\'ll do in the following example. \\n\\nLet\'s say we have a component that consists of an image and a heading. Image and heading are two simple components that come with the theme out-of-the-box.\\n\\nHere are a few examples of how this new component can be used:\\n- displaying a post\\n- displaying a user or an author\\n- displaying a photo with the photographer\'s name\\n- and many more...\\n\\nAs you can already see, there are many ways you can use this component. What helps expand the usability of this component even more are `attributes`. Let\'s say we have the following attributes:\\n- `imagePosition` - left, right, top, bottom\\n- `imageShape` - rectangular, circular\\n- `imageWidth` - 25%, 50%, 75%\\n- `headingColor` - black, blue, red\\n- `headingSize` - small, medium, large\\n\\nThese attributes give you the option to modify the look of the component, so this specific component can be used for the following:\\n\\n- **related posts** - rectangular image on the left side, 25% image width, heading takes up the remaining 75%, medium heading colored in blue\\n- **user avatar** - circular image on the left side, 25% image width, small heading colored in black\\n- **photo of the day** - rectangular image on the right side which takes 75% width and photographer\'s name is written in medium blue text\\n- **featured posts** - rectangular image on top, large heading in red color\\n\\n![Component with different attributes](/img/blog/components.png)\\n\\nYou can even add conditional logic to your options, e.g. to have the option for `imageWidth` visible only when `imagePosition` is set to left or right. And when `imagePosition` is set to top or bottom, it defaults to 100% width.\\n\\n## Block\\n\\nSo, what about blocks? Blocks can consist of one or more components and, most importantly, allow you to use them in the editor. Technically, blocks can consist of zero components, but we encourage you to build blocks from components because that increases the reusability.\\n\\n> Blocks give context to the components.\\n\\nNow that we have our component - let\'s call it `card-simple` - we can use it in a `Featured Posts` block. In **component\'s** `manifest.json`, we\'ve already defined how we want it to look by setting some defaults. When using this component in our block, we can override some attributes in **block\'s** `manifest.json`. Since it will be used for displaying featured posts, we can define that `imagePosition` should be set to **top**.\\n\\nAfter defining how we want our component to look while displaying featured posts, we need another attribute which will allow us to choose which posts to display in our block.\\n\\nTo do that, we\'ll add a new attribute called `featuredPosts` which will define which posts will be displayed in our block. For each selected post, another `card-simple` component is added, and featured image and post title are dynamically added to its image and heading components. More about the query logic and adding new options in a block will be covered in a future post.\\n\\nYou may be wondering, can you have a block that allows you to use all options of the `card-simple` component? Of course! You can create a block that allows you to set all available options in the editor and manually add content to the image and heading. There are also block variations, which allow you to set up predefined attributes for a block. More about setting up block variations may be covered in one of the future posts.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nHopefully, these examples helped you get a better understanding of the difference between components and blocks. It may take a bit more time or practical use to understand the difference and reasoning behind it. Our next post will walk you through downloading one of our components and blocks with WP CLI and modifying it."},{"id":"initial-setup","metadata":{"permalink":"/autool/blog/initial-setup","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-20-initial-setup.md","title":"Initial setup and first steps","description":"This blog post describes how to set up Eightshift Boilerplate theme, and covers some of the most common issues that may occur","date":"2022-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 20, 2022","tags":[{"label":"eightshift","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/eightshift"},{"label":"boilerplate","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/boilerplate"},{"label":"setup","permalink":"/autool/blog/tags/setup"}],"readingTime":2.585,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Igor Obradovi\u0107","title":"WordPress Engineer","url":"https://github.com/iobrado","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23059501?v=4","key":"obradovic"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Initial setup and first steps","description":"This blog post describes how to set up Eightshift Boilerplate theme, and covers some of the most common issues that may occur","slug":"initial-setup","authors":"obradovic","tags":["eightshift","boilerplate","setup"],"hide_table_of_contents":false},"prevItem":{"title":"Components and blocks","permalink":"/autool/blog/components-and-blocks"}},"content":"As is often the case when trying out something new, you might encounter some hiccups. You\'re trying out our Eightshift Boilerplate, but can\'t get it to work? Worry not, we\'ll go through the setup and the most common issues that may occur.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n> _**Last updated: 23rd August, 2022**_\\n\\nIf you haven\'t already, be sure to read our official Eightshift Docs.\\n\\n## Setup\\n\\nTo create Eightshift theme, navigate to `wp-content/themes` in your project and type the following in the terminal:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpx create-wp-project\\n```\\n\\nJust follow the instructions and wait for the theme to download.\\n\\n![Setup - initial prompt](/img/blog/setup-1.png)\\n\\nOK, you went through the process, filled out all required information, but the theme still isn\'t working. There are a few more instructions in the terminal on what to do next, but you may have skipped them. While the principle **\\"6 hours of debugging can save you 5 minutes of reading documentation\\"** is fun, sometimes it\'s just not worth it. Here\'s what you should do:\\n\\n- run `wp theme activate your-theme-name` to activate your new theme\\n- navigate to `wp-content/themes/your-theme-name`\\n- try running `wp boilerplate --help` to check if our WP CLI boilerplate commands work\\n- for easiest initial setup, run `wp boilerplate init theme`\\n- `npm start` should trigger automatically with the previous command. If it doesn\'t, you can run it manually to finish the theme build process\\n\\n![Setup - instructions](/img/blog/setup-2.png)\\n\\nCongratulations, you\'ve set up your Eightshift theme!\\n\\n## Getting to know Eightshift dev tools\\n\\nAfter successfully setting up the theme and going through files, you\'ll notice this file structure is quite different from traditional WordPress themes and you may think to yourself: \\"Oh wow, what did I get myself into?\\"\\n\\nWhile it may look scary and confusing at first, once you get used to the structure, you\'ll see the benefits. More about that will be covered in future posts, where we\'ll walk you through some basics of developing with Eightshift Boilerplate.\\n\\nYou may want to try a few of our WP CLI commands to add another component, block, or service class. Running `wp boilerplate --help` will give you a list of commands and their short description. If you need even more details about a specific command, you can type, e.g. `wp boilerplate create post-type --help`\\n\\nThe final tip in this post is related to troubleshooting. Maybe you tried to add a new class or a new feature to one of the existing blocks. And now the site has crashed. In tech support, the number 1 question is **\\"Have you tried turning it off and on again?\\"**. In our case, the number 1 question is:\\n\\n> Have you tried `composer dump-autoload` and re-running `npm start`?\\n\\n## What\'s next in store?\\n\\nThat\'s all for this post. In future posts we\'ll go through some more how-to examples like:\\n- the difference between components and blocks\\n- downloading components and blocks from our Storybook with WP-CLI\\n- adding new features to components and blocks\\n- adding custom fonts to your project\\n- adding custom queries which we\'ll use in one of our blocks\\n- and many more...\\n\\nSo stay tuned."}]}')}}]);
